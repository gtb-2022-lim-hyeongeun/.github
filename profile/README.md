## WELCOME TO HYEONGEUN'S PROFILE

Hi, i'm HyeongEun, I'm from Korea.   

I came to China in 2018.    
Before coming to China, I learned Chinese for about 5 years.    
So I was interested in Chinese language and culture and decided to study in China.   


This is me.

I love treveling. In china, I have been to Guilin, Chongqing, Shanghai, Chongqing huoguo and noodles are very delicious, and Hongya-dong is very magical.Shanghai is a very busy city, and I like it very much.   

I went to shanghai during the winter vacation. This is a picture I took in front of ‰∏úÊñπÊòéÁè†.
